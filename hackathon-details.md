3. Hackathon Rules
To keep things fair and aligned with our goals, all teams must follow these rules:

Open Source: Everything shown in the demo must be fully open source. This includes every component - backend, frontend, models, and any other parts of the project - published under an approved open source license.

New Work Only: All projects must be started from scratch during the hackathon with no previous work.

Team Size: Teams may have up to 2 members.

Banned Projects: Projects will be disqualified if they: violate legal, ethical, or platform policies, use code, data, or assets you do not have the rights to.

4. Problem Statements & Example Projects
Problem Statement One: Build a Tool That Should Exist — Create the AI-native app or workflow you wish someone had already built. Eliminate busywork. Make hard things effortless.

Example Projects:

Contract Lifecycle Autopilot - Extracts all obligations from contracts and tracks deadlines with automatic reminders

Product Changelog Publisher - Turns release notes into customer-facing announcements across multiple channels

Bug Report Enricher - Automatically adds system logs, user history, and reproduction steps to support tickets

Problem Statement Two: Break the Barriers — Expert knowledge, essential tools, AI's benefits — take something powerful that's locked behind expertise, cost, language, or infrastructure and put it in everyone's hands.

Example Projects:

Crop Doctor — Combines image analysis, weather data, and soil reports to diagnose plant diseases and recommend organic treatment protocols.

Accessibility Auditor — Evaluates websites, documents, and physical spaces against accessibility standards and generates remediation plans.

Open Source Hardware Guide — Helps makers navigate component selection, PCB design, and manufacturing for hardware projects.

Problem Statement Three: Amplify Human Judgment — Build AI that makes researchers, professionals, and decision-makers dramatically more capable — without taking them out of the loop. The best AI doesn't replace human expertise. It sharpens it.

Example Projects:

Brand Safety Monitor - Reviews ad placements and content adjacencies, flagging reputation risks for marketing teams

Discovery Anomaly Detector - Flags documents in discovery that should exist but are missing based on references in other documents

Grading Calibration Partner — Highlights scoring inconsistencies in instructor assessments, supporting but not overriding professional judgment on standards.

6. Judging
Judging for the Anthropic Virtual Hackathon happens in two stages:

Stage 1 – Asynchronous Judging
Date: Feb 16th - Feb 17th

How it works:

Judges review your submitted projects asynchronously via the judging platform.

Each team will have uploaded:

A short demo video (3 minute maximum)

Open Source Project repository / code

Written summary (100–200 words)

Judges independently evaluate projects using standardized criteria.
Judging Criteria:

Impact (25%) - What's the real-world potential here? Who benefits, and how much does it matter? Could this actually become something people use? Does it fit into one of the problem statements listed above?

Opus 4.6 Use (25%) - How creatively did this team use Opus 4.6? Did they go beyond a basic integration? Did they surface capabilities that surprised even us?

Depth & Execution (20%) — Did the team push past their first idea? Is the engineering sound and thoughtfully refined? Does this feel like something that was wrestled with — real craft, not just a quick hack?

Demo (30%) — Is this a working, impressive demo? Does it hold up live? Is it genuinely cool to watch?

After evaluation, the team aggregates scores to determine the Top 6 projects for the final round

Stage 2 – Final Round Live Judging
Date & Time: Feb 18th, 12:00PM EST

Format:

During the live session, pre-recorded demos from each team will be played (3 minutes per team).

Judges will deliberate after all demos to determine the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place along with extra prizes.

The top three and special prize winners will be announced during the closing ceremony at 1:30PM EST.

8. Prizes
1st Place: $50,000 in Claude API Credits

3rd Place: $10,000 in Claude API Credits

Most Creative Opus 4.6 Exploration: $5,000 in Claude API Credits

This prize is for the team that found the most interesting edge of this new model — the unexpected capability or the use case nobody thought to try. We want the project that taught us something new about what Opus 4.6 can do

The “Keep Thinking” Prize: $5,000 in Claude API Credits

For the project that didn't stop at the first idea. We're looking for the team that pushed past the obvious, iterated relentlessly, and showed the kind of depth that turns a good hack into something genuinely surprising.
