compeek turns Claude into an autonomous desktop agent that can see and interact with any application — just like a person would. Tell the AI what to do, point it at any software, and watch it work.

No APIs. No plugins. No integrations. Just screen and keyboard.

Built entirely during the hackathon, compeek features:

- **Browser-native agent loop** calling Opus 4.6 directly with extended thinking (no backend needed)
- **Real-time dashboard** visualizing the AI's reasoning and actions as they happen
- **Cross-OS support**: Linux containers, Windows VMs, and macOS VMs from a single CLI
- **MCP server** enabling Claude Code and other IDE agents to control desktops
- **Multimodal input**: attach document photos, and the agent extracts data and fills forms autonomously
- **Secure remote access** via Cloudflare Tunnel with bearer token auth
- **One command to start**: `npx @rmbk/compeek start --open`

compeek breaks the barrier between AI and desktop software — making autonomous computer use accessible to everyone.
